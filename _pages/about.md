I'm a graduate student in the Department of Mathematics at Zhejiang University, supervised by [Wangtao Lu](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/lwt). 

I was a Research Assistant in the Dapartment of Applied Mathematics at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, mentored by [Binyan Jiang](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/ama/people/academic-staff/dr-jiang-binyan/). Prior to that, I obtained my bachelor degree in Mathematics from Harbin Institute of Technology in 2022 under the supervision of [Zhaoyan Li](https://homepage.hit.edu.cn/lizhaoyan).

My research interests lie in mathematical statistics, specifically in network data analysis, proportion data analysis, and the theoretical aspects of neural networks. As a beginner in academic research, I enjoy learning any interesting and meaningful topic related to mathematics and its the applications from the industry.
