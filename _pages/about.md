I am a graduate student in the Department of Mathematics at Zhejiang University, under the supervision of [Wangtao Lu](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/lwt). 

Previously, I worked as a Research Assistant in the Department of Applied Mathematics at The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, under the mentorship of [Binyan Jiang](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/ama/people/academic-staff/dr-jiang-binyan/). Prior to that, I earned my bachelor's degree in Mathematics from Harbin Institute of Technology in 2022, where I was supervised by [Zhaoyan Li](https://homepage.hit.edu.cn/lizhaoyan).

My research interests focus on mathematical statistics, particularly in network data analysis, proportion data analysis, and the theoretical foundations of neural networks. As a newcomer to academic research, I am eager to explore any fascinating and impactful topics related to mathematics and its applications in industry.
